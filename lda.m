%Linear discriminant analysis training error rate is [YOUR VALUE].
%Linear discriminant analysis test error rate is [YOUR VALUE].

%This function takes in a training data matrix Xtrain, training
%label vector ytrain and uses them to compute the cat
%and dog sample mean vectors as well as the sample covariance matrix 
%(which is assumed to be equal for cats and dogs). 
%It also takes in a data matrix Xrun and produces a vector of
%label guesses yguess, corresponding to the ML rule for
%jointly Gaussian vectors with different means and the same 
%covariance matrix.
function yguess = lda(Xtrain,ytrain,Xrun)
