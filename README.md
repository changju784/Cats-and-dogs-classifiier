# EK381_project

This project is to design entire program that tells pictures of dog and cat. 
Each module has functionality of to extract digits from pixels and calculate means, variance, covariance, on Gaussian distribution. 
The dog picture is classified as 1, and cat piture is classified as 0, so they are linearly classified.
The error rate has to be minimized by adjusting the points.
