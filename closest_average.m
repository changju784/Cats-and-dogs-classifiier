%Closest average training error rate is [YOUR VALUE].
%Closest average test error rate is [YOUR VALUE].

%This function takes in a training data matrix Xtrain, training
%label vector ytrain and uses them to compute the average cat
%and dog vectors. It also takes in a data matrix Xrun and 
%produces a vector of label guesses yguess, corresponding to whether
%each row of Xtest is closer to the average cat or average dog.
function yguess = closest_average(Xtrain,ytrain,Xrun)
